        The oringal 295-card set, <b>Alpha</b>, was released in August of 1993. with about 2.6 million cards being produced. Of those 2.6 million cards, there were about 1,100 of each "rare" card,
        around 4,500 of each "uncommon", and about 16,000 of each "common" card.

        Of this 295-card set, some ended up being very highly sought-after-- a very few, in particular, and one above all else: Black Lotus.

      In the early days of Magic, an Alpha Black Lotus could be had for around $50; as late as 1999, they could be bought for around $400. Today, they rarely go for under $10,000, except in very poor condition,
      and regularly sell for many tens of thousands; Lotuses in mint condition have sold for well over $100,000.
